# GenAD

GenAD is a really simple python script that i found really useful during Active Directory testing. It takes a file with names and surnames you found and it generates a list of possible usernames that you can use to enumerate users on the domain (kerberos/smb/winrm/etc...). Input file should be in name + surname format like this: <br /> <br /> Aileen Wallace <br /> Charlotte Hall <br /> Evan Davies <br /> Ieuan Monks

```Usage: python3 genad.py <input_file>```
